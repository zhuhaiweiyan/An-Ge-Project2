# Battleship Game (Project 2)

## Overview

This project implements a web-based version of the classic **Battleship** board game using **JavaScript** and **React**. Players compete against an AI opponent in two distinct gameplay modes:

- **Normal Mode**: Players and AI alternate turns.
- **Free Play Mode**: Players freely target cells on the AI's board without AI retaliation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a **React-driven architecture**, leveraging:

- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`)
- **Context API** for global state management
- **React Router** for routing between pages
- **CSS Flexbox** for responsive styling
- **Local Storage** for game state persistence (Bonus)

### Key Components and Pages

- **`HomePage.js`**: Landing page with options for gameplay mode.
- **`GamePage.js`**: Main gameplay interface.
- **`RulesPage.js`**: Contains the rules and instructions.
- **`HighScoresPage.js`**: Placeholder for high scores.
- **`Board.js`**: Visualizes player and AI boards.
- **`Cell.js`**: Interactive board cells with different states.
- **`NavBar.js`**: Navigation component between different pages.
- **`Footer.js`**: Consistent footer across the site.
- **`ShipSetup.js` and `ShipPlacement.js`**: Handles ship placement logic and UI.
